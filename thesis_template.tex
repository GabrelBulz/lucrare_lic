Floods are without doubt the most devastating natural disasters, striking numerous regions in the world each year. During the last decades due the increased frequency of heavy rain and a continuously increasing concentration of population near water regions a lot of assets and lives were lost.

That is the reason why a system that can create a flood forecasting is  

To process the resulted images we will use a library in python called GDAL which can handle that specific type of files (.tif)

In the first part we will try to identify the areas nearby the rivers and lakes (because that areas are more likely to be flooded), and in the second part we will try to analyze the images based on the height of each section. The water from the rain will gather in the lower areas, so we can presume that that areas are likely to hold water.

\section{Motivation}
\quad
Water is an essential component of ecosystems for the sustainability of life on our planet. It balances ecosystems and maintains climate variation, carbon cycling, etc. It is equally important to humans and other forms of life. Its excess or absence could lead to disasters and extreme land use change. Hence, identification of water bodies is an essential process in science and engineering research. The identification can be useful in various ways, such as estimation of water areas and demarcation of flooded regions\cite {1,2}.
\par 

Floods are without doubt the most devastating natural disasters, striking numerous regions in the world each year. During the last decades due the increased frequency of heavy rain and a continuously increasing concentration of population near water regions a lot of assets and lives were lost.In general, less developed countries are the most vulnerable to floods, causing damages that significantly affect the national GDP. At country and community levels important initiatives have and are being devoted to implement appropriate countermeasures, both structural and non-structural, aiming to alleviate the persistent threats of water-related disasters. 
\par

Flood prediction models are of significant importance for hazard assessment and extreme event management.Robust and accurate prediction contribute highly to water recourse management strategies, policy suggestions and analysis, and further evacuation modeling \cite{3}.
\par

Thus, the importance of advanced systems for short-term and long-term prediction for flood and other hydrological events is strongly emphasized to alleviate damage \cite{4}. However, the prediction of flood lead time and occurrence location is fundamentally complex due to the dynamic nature of climate condition. Therefore, todayâ€™s major flood prediction models are mainly data-specific and involve various simplified assumptions \cite{5}. 
\par

Physically based models were long used to predict hydrological events, such as storm, rainfall/runoff, shallow water condition, hydraulic models of flow, and further global circulation phenomena , including the coupled effects of atmosphere, ocean, and floods, and this is why we chose to develop a physically based flood prediction model. Other types of prediction models are data-driven models e.g. machine learning or hybrid models which can combine data-driven, statistical and physically base models.
\par 

Physical models showed great capabilities for predicting a diverse range of flooding scenarios \cite{6},especially in long and mid-term prediction, although they often require various types of hydro-geomorphological monitoring datasets. 
\par 

In contrast to the physically based models, the data-driven prediction models using ML are shown to have a higher performance rate on both short-term and long-term forecasting compared to the physically based models, furthermore, the literature includes numerous successful experiments of quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF) using ML methods for different lead-time predictions \cite{7,8}. In addition,  it was shown that the performance of ML could be improved through hybridization  with other ML methods, soft computing techniques, numerical simulations, and/or physical models. Such applications provided more robust and efficient models that can effectively learn complex flood systems in an adaptive manner. Although the literature includes numerous evaluation performance analyses of individual ML models \cite{9-12}, there is no definite conclusion reported with regards to which models function better in certain applications. In fact, the literature includes only a limited number of surveys on specific ML methods in specific hydrology fields {13-15}. Consequently, there is a research gap for a comprehensive literature review in the general applications of ML in all flood resource variables from the perspective of ML modeling and data-driven prediction systems.
\par 

Although the data-driven models using ML can be much efficient in some cases there is a still a big draw back regarding their development and use. For a data-driven model to have a high accuracy it will be needed a very large amount of training data, which can be hard to acquire due the weather conditions and monitoring devices availability time. Furthermore the development of a data-driven model using ML is very expensive because it requires a complex model which needs to be trained for a long period of time, requiring a high computation cost, and it also requires a longer validation, testing, and evaluation period.
\par

Even dough the data-driven models using ML can be a great scientific tool they tend to be hard to understood by a non trained person, and they can require, as shown above, a high run cost and a data set which can be very difficult to acquire by every person. This is why we chose to develop a physically prediction model which can be used by everybody with a low run cost, which requires a minimum data-set easy to obtain via different services like Sentinel 1,2,3 or Landsat satellite images programs. This app has the potential to serve regular people when making decisions about where to buy a property, or where to build a house without any risk saving lots of money.
\par


\section{Our Contribution}
\subsection{Method and Outline}

This paper identifies the state of the art of physically methods for flood prediction taking into account the processing time, cost, efficiency and difficulty to use. The methods that we used shown a very significant performance and accuracy rate.
\par

The applications in flood prediction can be classified according to flood resource variables, i.e. river flow, flood peak discharge, urban flood and plain flood. Among these key influencing flood resource variables, and the spatial examination of the topographical images the application include the possibility to detect with high accuracy the water surfaces (over 82\% accuracy from all tests).
\par

The mainly methods that we used in the application were the detection of water and flooding a land area based on the topographical images. The water detection was obtained by combining a set of near infrared (or NIR) and green band satellite images, and then applying a method of extraction called normalized difference water index (NDWI). This method is based on the extraction the water bodies taking into account the reflectance property of water.
\par 

After the water has been detected, the land area is filled based on the topological map of the surface. One of the problems that we encountered here is ,besides the water detection, the fact that the topological satellite images tend to cover a bigger area than the NIR and green band area from the satellite images, so we had to map the smaller NIR images into the bigger topological images, but we will discuss this problem and how we solve it in the following chapters. The resulting product of our application is a area that has a high possibility of being flooded during a heavy rainstorm, results that can be achieved using a very low processing time, cost and resources.
\par 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{application_outline.png} 
	Fig 1
\end{center}

Combining those techniques with an easy to use and understand client interface we managed to create a system that can predict the land areas with a high potential of being flooded. The processing time and cost are reduced because the server part has to go through a set of images only twice, first time to detect the surface water and second time to fill the land area based on the topographic map, so the computations are reduced as low as possible. On the client side, there are big advantages because the set of resources (satellite images) are free and easy to access and the results are easy to understand, making this application ideal for a non trained person.
\par





\subsection{State of Art of Physically models in flood prediction}

\quad
For creating our physically prediction model we chose to use NDWI water extraction technique due its ease use and low processing time. McFeeters \cite{16} developed the normalized difference water index (NDWI) using the reflectance of the green (band 2) and near-infrared (band 4) bands of Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper). NDWI is one of the most widely used water indices for a variety of applications, including surface water mapping, land use/cover change analyses, and ecological research \cite{17-19} and also it shown great classification accuracy in areas that include shadow and dark surfaces.

\section{Technologies used}

\subsection{Collecting and processing the resources}

\subsubsection{Collecting the resources}

\quad
Our prediction model was created with a simple scope in mind, to offer a simply  application that can predict the areas with high risk of being flooded during a rainstorm, with as little processing time and cost as possible. The input for our model had to be easy to obtained and the output had to be easy to understand, so we chose to use a input data that is both easy to obtained and free (it will need to be accessible by every person). The input for our model is a set of .tiff images that should contain a near infrared image (NIR), a green band image, and a topographic image. A simple way to obtain the NIR and green band images is by using the available data offered by satellites like Landsat 1 to Landsat 8 or Sentinel 2. 

\par 
The Landsat project is one of the longest-running enterprise projects for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. The project was first developed by NASA and then it was transferred to NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) by U.S Jimmy Carter's presidential directive. There were 8 Landsat satellites on the Earth's orbit, now only 2 of them are still active, and the resources collected are available on the USGS (U.S Geological Survey) website. The only thing that a user will need in order to access the data is a free account. After the account is created the user can select different areas via USGS's EarthExplorer portal and download the area's satellite imagery using filters like Data Range or satellite preference (Landsat satellite 1-8).
\par

\bigskip

\includegraphics[scale=0.5, right]{landsat_search.png} 
\begin{center}
Fig 2 - \cite{20}
\end{center}

The image presented above (fig 2) is a shot taken while searching for our test data from a region in U.S (Cairo) that was heavy flooded during a rainstorm by the Mississippi river. The yellow and pink areas represents two different scenes captured by the Landsat 7 satellite. A set of 8 images are found in a package downloaded from this website depending on the satellite that had provided them, but all the Landsat satellites imagery set contains a NIR and green band shot of the selected area (the main difference between them is the resolution in meters of the photo). We used in our research mainly Landsat's 7 images because the photos are at a higher resolution (30 m) and most of them are already processed by the USGS servers (some images need to be processed by the internal servers before being available to the users).

\includegraphics[scale=0.73, center]{Capture.png} 
\begin{center}
Fig 3 - \cite{21}
\end{center}


\medskip

As we specified above there is another option to obtain the images besides Landsat, and that is through the Sentinel program. Sentinel is an observation mission from the Eu Copernicus Programme that acquires optical imagery of Earth at large resolution (10 to 60 m) over land and coastal waters. There are 3 satellites launched by the Copernicus Programme but we will focus mainly on Sentinel 2, because it has the largest collected data. 
\par 

The Sentinel 2 satellite has a multi-spectral instrument with 13 spectral channels in the visible, short wave and near infrared spectral range. The bands that are interesting for us are the 3-rd band which is the green one and the 8-th band which is the NIR one (the bands have a spatial resolution of 10 m). The images  can be downloaded from the Copernicus Scihub website, again by creating a free account. There is a possibility to select a date range, cloud coverage in percents and the satellite platform which is the best suitable for the user needs (I.E Sentinel 1,2 or 3). 
\par 

\bigskip

\includegraphics[scale=0.54, center]{sentinel.png} 
\begin{center}
Fig 4 - \cite{22}
\end{center}
\par 


Still, there are some drawbacks from using the Sentinel imagery. We chose to use the Landsat images over Sentinel's data set, because the Sentinel 1 images are at a lower resolution, and the Sentinel 2 and 3 images are too recent taken (the satellites were launched in 2015, so the data could not cover a larger time period for our data analysis).
\par 

After we obtained the NIR and green band images we will need to download a topographic map of the area ,that will be processed. The topographic map can be taken from USGS website by searching for digital elevation maps. The process is pretty similar to the one of collecting Landsat imagery. A interesting difference between a NIR and a topographic image is represented by the images size. The topographic image is usually taken over a larger field, and this is a problem that we encountered during the processing of the areas with high flood risk. We needed to determine where to place the smaller image inside the bigger one based on coordinates, but we will discuss about this problem in one of the following sections.
\par

\subsubsection{Processing the resources}

\quad
Before a set of images can be processed by our application they need to be rendered. For this process we used a program called QGIS. Qgis is an open source geographic information system, created by OSGeo (Open Source Geospatial Foundation), licensed under GNU, that supports numerous vector, raster and database formats and functionalities \cite{23}.
\par 

The images will need to be rendered from 8 bit depth to 32 bit depth and the pixel range value will be mapped between 0 and 255. They will also need to be saved with .TIF extension, to be later processed by our servers.
\par 

The Sentinel images are pretty straight forward to rendered, but the images from Landsat will need an extra step before being ready to save. The Landsat 7 images have what seems to be "black stripes" across the side of the image. This is due to a failure of Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector. The forward movement of the satellite on the orbit should be compensated by The Scan Line Corrector, but because of the failure a zigzag pattern of ground tracking is used instead of a mapping in straight lines. This can be seen very clearly in the image below (fig 5), and the location of the black stripes varies between 390-450 m; therefore US Geological Survey(USGS) estimates that affected images lose about 22\% of their data \cite{24}.

\bigskip

\includegraphics[scale=0.54, center]{landsat_black_stripes.png} 
\begin{center}
Fig 5
\end{center}
\par 

\quad
The black lines get smaller as we approach the center of the image, which means that we can crop some parts of the land area and use them without any future modification, or if we need to use the full image we can try to apply a image correction, which should fill the black lines based on the gap masks offered by Landsat (for this part we will need to have Gdal installed). Below we can see how a mask layer looks like (fig 6).
\par 


\bigskip

\includegraphics[scale=0.54, center]{landsat_black_stripes_correction.png} 
\begin{center}
Fig 6
\end{center}
\par 

After the images are ready they can be rendered by saving the image with .tif extension and checking the "render image" box.



\section{Programming languages and Frameworks} 

\subsection{Programming language: Java}
\medskip

\quad
Java is popular object-oriented programming language that was designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It was created in 1995 by Sun Microsystems and now it is owned by Oracle.
\par

This project was developed using Java 1.8 with two external libraries i.e.: Gdal and jai-imageio-core 1.4.0. Any version below 1.6 will now work as intended because of jai-imageio-core library. These libraries were used to process the TIFF images from satellite.
\par

At first we intended to use Python as the heavy lifting programming language because of the more relaxed syntactic structure, but in the end we chose Java because of its parallel programming capabilities. Usually when we have to work with satellite images we should take into account the fact that the images can be really large, like 8161x7211 pixels in size covering over 589.000.000 $km^2$, and when we have to process more that one image of this kind the processing time becomes very important.
\par

Python will become much slower in this area because of the Global Interpreter Lock or GIL (a mutex, or a lock, that allows only one thread to be in a state of execution at any point in time). The impact of the GIL is visible only to developers who execute multi-threaded programs, because it can create a performance bottleneck at the CPU level.
 \par
 
\bigskip

In the following image (fig 7) we can take a look over the processing time between the Java's multi-threaded system and the single-threaded Python's system
\par

\bigskip

\begin{center}
Fig 7
\end{center}
\par 
\includegraphics[scale=0.7, center]{multi_thread2.png}

\quad
The tests were made by us on a sample of 8 images with an average size of 1000x1000 px, and the results shown that the java multi-threaded system (marked with blue on fig 7) was in average faster with 40\% than the python single-threaded system. We valued this feature very much because the reduced time of processing combined with the image handling power offered by java helped us to create a time and cost efficient application, and that is what we intended at first.


\subsection{Programming language: Python}
\medskip

\quad
Python is a interpreted, high-level, open source programming language that was made to have a  relaxed syntactic structure and to be more easy to read. It supports both functional and object oriented programming and its mainly targeted to a fast development and easy to maintain code.
\par

Python had played a major role in the project because of its relaxed syntactic structure and it was use to create the server part of the application, using Flask (flask is a microframework for python web based applications).
\par 

After the server receives a set of satellite images from the user, a Java process is started by the server to solve the request. The java files are complied when the server is started for the first time and then for every request a java process is started. All this part was handled using the python's "subprocess" library
\par
\medskip

We will take a short look on how the python server compiles the java files and how a process is started, and we will discuss in more details in the next chapters.
\medskip

Here we can take a short look on how the java files are compiled
\par
\bigskip

Here we can take a look on how a process is started
\par
\medskip
\includegraphics[scale=0.7, center]{python_call_java_2.png}
\begin{center}
Fig 9
\end{center}

\subsection{Gdal Library}

\quad
Gdal (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is a software library available for multiple programming languages (python, java, c++) for manipulating rasters and geospatial data vectors. It was released by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) in the 2000 year with a permissive X/MIT free software license\cite{25}. 
\par 

We used Gdal as a Java library to process the satellite images. We needed a way to extract the coordinates of specific pixels from .Tif images, and The Gdal library offered a convenient way of doing that by using gdal.Datasets, gdal.Band and the GeoTransform matrix.

\subsection{Flask Framework}

\quad
Flask is a web framework written for Python which is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries, and it is really light weight because it has no database abstraction, no user authentication and no form validation.
\par 

Flask was developed based on the template engines offered by Jinja 2, which can enable a accelerated development for our web application. It also offers a micro but extensible web framework, which can become very flexible by using several widely used web development tools and libraries \cite{26}.
\par 

There is an another available web framework dedicated to Python which we took into consideration when we built this application and that is Django. At first look Django seemed a better choice than Flask, because it has a better template engine than Flask, it has a ORM (object-relational mapping) system that can work with several databases like SQLite, Oracle and MySQL and it has a built-in bootstrapping tool, but despite all this upsides, which can make the application development much easier, there are some drawbacks when using Django. Even though Django could offer a cheaper App development, we should also take a look on how a Django HTTP server will compare to a HTTP Flask server.
\par 

We had to consider the fact that the machine on which our application will run will need to be cheap to maintained, and it should be pretty responsive, which means that it should have a low latency (that was one of our main focuses). We took a look on several benchmarks that compared the performance obtained by Flask and Dajngo during longer sessions of run time, because the available resources tend to change with time. We had to determine how they can handle a more intensive environment where the available resources can decrease. Like on the real machines where the decrease of resource is non linear because the OS can spawn daemons or trigger some side jobs, we had to find some tests that will take this facts into account, and we found that the HTTP Flask server performs much better than the HTTP Django server in this king of conditions. The test that we take into consideration were made using Gunicorn (a Python Web Server Gateway HTTP interface) at a constant 4000 queries per seconds. In the tests the HTTP Falsk server displayed a lower latency and  error numbers and a higher request number compared to the HTTP Django server.

\section{Application specification - user's point of view}

{\Large User's point of view\par}

This app should be able to deliver a marked zone on the land area(provided by the user), based on the probabilities of that zone to be floodable. (ex: red for high probability, green for none)\par 

The user will have to insert a set of images provided by sentinel 1,2 or 3, or a .tif representation of the area which he wants to test. The .tif set of images should include a infrared picture as well, because that is the way in which the water can be detected. The satellites usually use infrared scanners so this would not be a problem. The infrared images are useful because the water will absorb the infrared laser, so the areas covered with water are usually black. This is how the program will find the water areas, and will be able to detect the zones which have a higher chance of being flooded. Depending on the progress of the program, we will try to offer a GUI for the user in which he/she will be able to insert the coordinates of the area under the observation, and we will try to download the images based on their coordinated using a API for sentinel satellites.

\par 
The resulted image will give the user a sense of which areas are more likely of being flooded during a heavy rain period.

\newpage

\section{Application specification - programmer's point of view}

{\Large User's point of view and application skeleton\par}

This app should be able to deliver a marked zone on the land area(provided by the user), based on the probabilities of that zone to be floodable. (ex: red for high probability, green for none)\par 

The app will receive a set of .tif images, (provided by the user) from Landsat, sentinel 1,2 or 3, one image will be in infrared and the other one will be composed from the green wave channel.\par
 The way that we detect water is by combining the NIR(infrared) with green band resulting NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index). NDWI  is a remote sensing based indicator sensitive to the change in the water content.NDWI  is computed  using  the  near  infrared  (NIRâ€“MODIS  band  2)  and  the  short  wave infrared (Green band) reflectanceâ€™s.\par 
The formula will be applied as following for each pixel:

$$ NDWI/perpixel = \frac{Xgreen - Xnir}{Xgreen + Xnir}$$

If the resulted pixel has a value bigger that 0.45 we classify that specific pixel as a pixel that contains/is water (lake, river, ocean, etc), and all the pixels below that value as non-water pixels (land). We will color the water pixels in white and the other ones in black. \par 

Using this method we will obtain all the water content of a picture, and we can mark the areas which have a high risk of being flooded(the areas near the water). \par 

Later the user will be able to add a set of topographic images and determine the exact areas that will be flooded, by combining the results from NDWI water area detection with the topographic height of the map.
